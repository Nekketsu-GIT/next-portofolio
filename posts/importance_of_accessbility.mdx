description: "Technology plays a significant role in our daily lives, and its impact is continually growing. Like education and other essential needs, it should be accessible to everyone. Older applications often overlooked accessibility, making them difficult or impossible for people with disabilities to use. Today, accessibility has become a priority for software teams. But why is accessibility so important, and what does it mean? This article explores these questions."

## What is Accessibility?

Accessibility refers to the design of products, devices, services, or environments to ensure usability for people with disabilities. It encompasses both:

- **Direct access** – Unassisted usability without requiring additional tools.
- **Indirect access** – Compatibility with assistive technologies such as screen readers.

By prioritizing accessibility, developers create inclusive digital experiences that accommodate a diverse range of users.

## Why is Accessibility Important?

Accessibility is crucial in software development for several reasons:

- **Legal Compliance** – Many countries mandate accessibility standards, such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0.
- **Ethical Responsibility** – Ensuring accessibility promotes inclusivity, allowing people with disabilities to engage fully in society.
- **Business Growth** – Accessible software reaches a broader audience, expanding the potential customer base.
- **Technical Benefits** – Accessible software tends to be more robust, flexible, and user-friendly for a wide range of people.

## What Does Accessibility Mean in Practice?

Accessibility covers a broad spectrum of disabilities, including visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments. However, accessibility isn't only about permanent disabilities; it also benefits individuals with temporary or situational limitations, such as:

- A user with a broken arm who can't use a mouse.
- Someone in a noisy environment who relies on captions.
- A person using a device with a cracked screen.

By designing with accessibility in mind, developers create software that is more usable for everyone, improving the overall user experience.
